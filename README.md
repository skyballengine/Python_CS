# What does the game do?
This is a word game called Sneaky Squirrel that takes the player through different trees in the forest. 
The player (Squirrel :) ) must gather all the nuts from the various types of trees before they encounter Fiendish Fox, who will eat Squirrel.

# What parts of the program were well done?
I felt like the program went pretty well, the game loop functioned properly.

# What parts of the game weren't well done?
There were a few things, but I can't remember at this point, they would show up if we ran the program a few times.
